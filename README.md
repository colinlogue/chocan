This is a repository for the CS 300 group project.

## Directory layout
```
  chocan
  |-- src
  |   | - ClassOne.java
  |   | - ClassTwo.java etc.
  |-- tests
  |   | - ClassOneTest.java
  |   | - ClassTwoTest.java etc.
  | - README.md
```
The `src` directory is where all the `.java` files go. If it gets too
cluttered we can add some subfolders.
The `tests` directory should contain the unit tests for each class.

If you're using IntelliJ, mark the `src` as Sources Root by right
clicking and selecting Mark Directory As > Sources Root, and the same
with the `tests` folder as Test Sources Root.
