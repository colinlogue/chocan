The `src` directory is where all the `.java` files go. If it gets too
cluttered we can add some subfolders.
The `tests` directory should contain the unit tests for each class.

If you're using IntelliJ, mark the `src` as Sources Root by right
clicking and selecting Mark Directory As > Sources Root, and the same
with the `tests` folder as Test Sources Root.
