The `src` directory is where all the `.java` files go. If it gets too
cluttered we can add some subfolders.
The `tests` directory should contain the unit tests for each class.

If you're using IntelliJ, mark the `src` as Sources Root by right
clicking and selecting Mark Directory As > Sources Root, and the same
with the `tests` folder as Test Sources Root.

## Guidelines for Collaboration
- `git pull` before you begin coding for a day to ensure you're seeing the current code
- Create a branch for your work
- Only merge your branch into the master branch when you are confident everything is working.
- Add anything to this document that you think might be helpful
  ([here is git's markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- other ideas to ensure smooth integration<3

## Basic Steps for pull/pushing changes:
1. pull from git
2. make sure you are on your own branch
3. merge changes from the master branch
4. do code stuff on your local branch, commit it to your branch
5. pull again after you commit
6. switch to the master branch, merge your changes with master branch
7. push
8. success

## Guidelines for working on your sections
- DON'T change the name or type signature (inputs/outputs) for any of
  the public functions.
- IF YOU DO NEED TO CHANGE IT, make sure to tell everyone so we can
  refactor any code portions that have been using them.
- Do whatever the heck you want with the private methods in your class.
- Do comment liberally, even in the private methods, just in case
  someone else needs to figure out what you've done.
- Only push to the master branch pieces that you are satisfied are
  working correctly.

## Accessing data from the database
Most methods are going to require looking up stored data or storing
new data. There are three patterns for this: retrieving information
about something that already exists, modifying information for
something that already exists, or creating a new thing.

**A note on exceptions:** These examples all have try/catch blocks
whenever the database is accessed. You could also have the function
you're writing re-throw the `SQLException` and catch it in an
earlier frame, if that makes sense for your control flow. Just know
that any time you are using the database, there is a chance it will
fail (e.g. if data is missing or doesn't match).

### Retrieving existing information
```java
private void do_something(int thing_id) {
    // 1) attempt to load data
    try {
        ThingData thing = ThingData.retrieve(thing_id);
    }
    catch (SQLException e) {
       // handle case where loading fails
    }
    
    // 2) do something with that data
    String value = thing.value;    // data members are public
    do_the_thing(value);           // use the data for some purpose
    
    // note that this pattern does NOT call write, so nothing in
    // the database is changed
}
```

### Modifying existing information
```java
private void update_record(int thing_id) {
    // 1) attempt to load data
    try {
        ThingData thing = ThingData.retrieve(thing_id);
    }
    catch (SQLException e) {
        // handle case where loading fails
    }
    
    // 2) change some value in that data
    thing.value = get_value();     // set data directly
    
    // 3) attempt to save the changes
    try {
        thing.write();
    }
    catch (SQLException e) {
        // handle case where saving fails
    }
}
```

### Creating new information
```java
private int create_new_thing() {
    // 1) create a new instance of the data class
    ThingData thing = new ThingData();
    
    // 2) set the data member values directly
    thing.value = get_value();
    thing.another_value = get_another_value();
    
    // note: do NOT manually set the ident value
    // that will be automatically set when the
    // write method is called
    
    // 3) attempy to save (creates new DB row)
    try {
        thing.write();
    }
    catch (SQLException e) {
        // handle case where saving fails
    }
    
    // 4) after saving, the instance will have an ident
    //    value that was generated by the write method,
    //    which this example function returns
    return thing.ident;
}
```

## Dependencies
The project relies on one external library to provide the
driver for the database. It is located in the `lib` directory.
In order to compile, the archive that holds the driver must
be added to the classpath. For command line compilation,
calling `make run` from the root directory will automatically
compile and run the `Simulation` class with the appropriate
classpath set.

For those using IntelliJ, you can right click the `.jar` file
in the `lib` directory and add it as a library. It will be
included when you build after that.

The command for running `<classname>` from the root (chocan)
directory is:

```bash
$ java -cp ./out/production:./lib/*.jar <classname>
```
